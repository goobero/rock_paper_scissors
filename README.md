# rock_paper_scissors

In this project, I created my first JavaScript program in the form of a rock, paper, scissors game. The first part of the project involved writing JavaScript functions to get the basics of the program working. The second part involved adding a UI element to the program, and using DOM methods to add interactivity to the page. I learnt about the following things:

-Functions, return values
-Addressing errors
-DOM methods e.g. adding event listeners
-Refresher for CSS and flexbox
