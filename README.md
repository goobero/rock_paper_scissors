# rock_paper_scissors

In this project, I created my first JavaScript program in the form of a rock, paper, scissors game. The first part of the project involved writing JavaScript functions to get the basics of the program working. The second part involved adding a UI element to the program, and using DOM methods to add interactivity to the page. I learnt about the following things:

* Writing functions and return values
* Using error messages to identify and debug errors
* Using DOM methods to target nodes. Understanding how to add event listeners to one/multiple nodes, to listen for and react to events
* Refreshed CSS and flexbox knowledge
